### Triplet initializer for blaze-lib CompressedMatrix

Surprisingly blaze-lib does not offer triplet initialization for sparse
matrices. This is a quick and dirty implementation that allows it.
See the main() for the details, the code should be self-explaining.

One day I will do a PR to the blaze-lib, however now I do not have much
time to make this code PR-ready. Sorry.
